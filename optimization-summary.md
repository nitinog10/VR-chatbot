## Next Recommended Steps

### High Priority (10-15MB additional savings)
1. **Convert GIFs to modern formats**:
   - `voice.gif` (12MB) → WebP/MP4 (~2-3MB)
   - `ai3.gif` (7.3MB) → WebP/MP4 (~1-2MB)

### Medium Priority
2. **Add build process for minification** (20-30% additional compression)
3. **Implement service worker** for offline functionality
4. **Add CDN** for faster global delivery

### Code Quality
- Move API key to environment variables
- Add comprehensive testing
- Implement Progressive Web App features
